# Description of the projects


This project involves developing an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline capable of processing unstructured video from the municipal cameras of the town of Quiberon.

The aim is to extract the videos, use the OpenCV2 library to analyze and process the video data in order to see if there is at least one person in the beach, then save the results in a BigQuery database for further analysis.
